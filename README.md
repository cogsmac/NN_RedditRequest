# Background

This is a very simple parallel coordinates plot made using R's ggplot package. It is meant as a starting point and needs a lot of aesthetic work. It's a twenty minute project in response to a stranger on the internet's need to visualize the properties of their neural network and to see what was working and what wasn't. Recommend "details on demand" at scale so that the user can hover over points to see the desired information rather than the label-heavy mess it currently is. 

# Data 

I didn't fully understand the scope of the data, so I made some simplifications to eliminate additional information. It takes the main performance variable to be the metric of interest. 

# Additional

Please feel free to fork and make this better. I'll accept pull requests upon review.
